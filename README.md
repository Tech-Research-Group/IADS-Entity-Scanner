# IADS Graphics Scanner

### Introduction
To use this application open your current WIP folder by clicking "WIP FOLDER" and select all TXT/XML files. This will bring up a preview of the DOCTYPE tag
along with entities for each graphic used within each work package. If the preview of each work package DOCTYPE and its entities looks correct, click 
"UPDATE FILES" to add the DOCTYPE tags to the beginning of each work package. You should receive a success popup if everything works correctly.

*Make sure none of your work packages start with a blank line. That will cause issues when the scanner tries to update that work package. Also, make
sure each graphic, symbol, icon-set, back and authent tag starts at the beginning of their own line to ensure the scanner reads and updates each graphic
properly.*
